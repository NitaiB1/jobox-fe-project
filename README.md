# jobox-fe-project
This repo is for the job apllication process at jobox.

Please note that any commits will trigger a CI/CD pipeline to build + deploy the application on the production site: https://joboxapp-nitaib.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/

I am aware that my architecture style does not follow the microservice style type but as of 10/08/2022, I had only just learned Node.js/Express.js and React.js from an IBM certificate.

I was not comfortable with implementing that style because of time constraints, I only had 2 days to build the application so I decided to just use HTML, CSS + BootStrap, JavaScript + jQuery as I knew that I would be able to deliver something that works.

I also realized that I should use containers (I am currently learning Docker + Kubernetes) because one of the versions had worked on my pc but not when it was deployed.
